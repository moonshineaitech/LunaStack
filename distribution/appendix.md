# 🗺️ FLOW MAPS — How Protocols Connect

Protocols aren't isolated. They chain. These maps show the standard flows.

# 📋 WORKED EXAMPLES — Protocols Producing Real Output

### Example: /premortem on "AI-powered resume builder"

```
PREMORTEM: AI Resume Builder
════════════════════════════

It's 6 months from now. The product failed. Here's why:

TECHNICAL FAILURES
  1. AI generates hallucinated work experience that users don't catch
     Likelihood: HIGH | Impact: CATASTROPHIC (legal liability)
     Early warning: User reports of inaccurate content in first 2 weeks
     Prevention: Mandatory human review step. AI highlights generated vs user-provided content with visual distinction.

  2. PDF export breaks across ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems)
     Likelihood: HIGH | Impact: HIGH (resumes get rejected silently)
     Early warning: Low callback rates reported by users
     Prevention: Test against top 10 ATS systems before launch. Simple formatting > fancy design.

PRODUCT FAILURES
  1. Users don't trust AI with their career — they use it once and go back to Google Docs
     Likelihood: HIGH | Impact: FATAL
     Early warning: D7 retention < 10%
     Prevention: Start with AI-assisted editing (suggestions), not AI-generated (full drafts). Build trust incrementally.

  2. LinkedIn import makes the whole thing feel like a commodity
     Likelihood: MEDIUM | Impact: HIGH
     Early warning: 80% of users just import + export with zero edits
     Prevention: The value must be BEYOND formatting. Tailoring to specific job descriptions is the wedge.

EXECUTION FAILURES
  1. Building for "everyone" means building for no one
     Likelihood: HIGH | Impact: HIGH
     Early warning: No clear user segment dominates signups
     Prevention: Pick ONE persona (new grad? career switcher? executive?) and nail it.

TOP 3 RISKS (by likelihood × impact)
  #1 Users don't trust AI with their career → start with assistance, not generation
  #2 ATS compatibility → test before launch, not after
  #3 No clear target user → pick a segment and commit

KILL CRITERIA
  Stop if: <5% D7 retention after 500 signups
  Stop if: >20% of AI content flagged as inaccurate by users
  Stop if: No segment shows >15% paid conversion after 2 months
```

### Example: /verify output on a PR

```
VERIFICATION BOARD
══════════════════
Files: 6 | Lines changed: +142 / -31

[CRITICAL] Security — SQL injection in search endpoint
  File: src/search/handler.ts:34
  Issue: User query interpolated into raw SQL via template literal
  Fix: Use parameterized query: db.query('SELECT * FROM items WHERE name ILIKE $1', [`%${query}%`])
  Confidence: 99%

[HIGH] Performance — N+1 in order listing
  File: src/orders/list.ts:22
  Issue: Loop fetches customer for each order individually (50 orders = 50 queries)
  Fix: Eager load with .findMany({ include: { customer: true } }) or batch query
  Confidence: 95%

[MEDIUM] Structure — Error swallowed silently
  File: src/payments/charge.ts:67
  Issue: catch block logs error but returns success response to client
  Fix: Return 500 with user-friendly message. Log with correlation ID for debugging.
  Confidence: 88%

[MEDIUM] Accessibility — Form inputs missing labels
  File: src/components/SearchForm.tsx:12
  Issue: <input> has placeholder but no <label> — screen readers can't identify the field
  Fix: Add <label htmlFor="search">Search items</label> (can be visually hidden if needed)
  Confidence: 92%

[LOW] Style — Inconsistent error handling pattern
  File: src/orders/create.ts vs src/orders/update.ts
  Issue: create.ts uses try/catch, update.ts uses .catch() — inconsistent within same module
  Fix: Standardize on try/catch (matches rest of codebase)
  Confidence: 80%

VERDICT: ❌ BLOCKED
  Blocking: 1 critical (SQL injection), 1 high (N+1)
  Fix these two, then re-run /verify.
  Board confidence: 91%

### Example: /cfo on a SaaS pricing model

```
UNIT ECONOMICS: ProjectTracker SaaS
════════════════════════════════════

CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost): $127
  Channels: Google Ads ($89 avg), content/SEO ($45 avg), referral ($23 avg)
  Blended: $127 based on current channel mix (40/40/20)

LTV (Lifetime Value): $864
  ARPU: $29/mo (Pro plan average)
  Gross margin: 82% (hosting + support costs)
  Avg lifespan: 36 months (2.8% monthly churn)
  LTV = $29 × 0.82 × 36 = $856

LTV:CAC Ratio: 6.7:1 ✅ (target: >3:1)
Payback Period: 5.3 months ✅ (target: <12)

BURN ANALYSIS
  Monthly burn: $47K (team: $38K, infra: $5K, tools: $4K)
  Current MRR: $31K (1,069 customers)
  Runway: 14 months at current burn (assuming $200K in bank)
  Breakeven: $57K MRR (need ~970 more customers at $29 avg)

PRICING RECOMMENDATION
  Current: $19/mo Starter, $29/mo Pro, $79/mo Team
  Issue: 71% of revenue from Pro. Starter barely covers cost-to-serve ($4.20/user).
  Recommendation:
    - Raise Starter to $24 (or make it a 14-day trial → Pro)
    - Add annual billing at 17% discount ($290/yr Pro) — improves cash + reduces churn
    - Team plan needs usage limits, not just seat count, to capture enterprise value
```

### Example: /brand framework

```
BRAND FRAMEWORK: Ridgeline (project management for construction)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Purpose:     Construction teams shouldn't need a CS degree to manage a project.
Audience:    General contractors running 3-10 active residential projects.
Position:    We are the project management tool for builders who hate software.
Personality: Straightforward, rugged, reliable. NOT: corporate, trendy, complicated.
Voice:       Talk like a foreman, not a consultant. Short sentences. No jargon.
Promise:     You'll know the status of every job without opening a laptop.
Proof:       Mobile-first daily logs. Photo-based progress tracking. One-tap updates.
Enemy:       Not Procore (they serve enterprise). The enemy is the whiteboard-and-text-messages workflow that loses information.

# ⚠️ UNIVERSAL ANTI-PATTERNS — What Goes Wrong Across All Protocols

These mistakes appear in every discipline. They're built into LunaStack's Gotchas sections, but collected here for reference.

**1. Skipping discovery.** The #1 failure. Building before understanding. /inquiry exists because most failed projects solved the wrong problem, not because they solved it poorly.

**2. Premature specificity.** Designing the database before understanding the user. Writing code before writing a spec. Optimizing before profiling. Every protocol has a prerequisite — respect the order.

**3. Vague acceptance criteria.** "It should work correctly" is not a criterion. If you can't write a test for it, you can't verify it. /spec forces Given/When/Then for this reason.

**4. Single-reviewer syndrome.** One perspective misses what six catch. /verify runs parallel agents because the bugs you ship are the ones your ONE reviewer has a blind spot for.

**5. Context window abuse.** Stuffing everything into one session until quality degrades. /fresh, /snapshot, /handoff, /subagent-pattern, and /context-budget all exist because context is finite and precious.

**6. No learning loop.** Doing the same work, making the same mistakes, session after session. /retro → /learn → /compound is the flywheel that makes LunaStack better than a prompt library.

**7. Heroics over systems.** Relying on one person to remember the right thing instead of encoding it in protocols. If a practice depends on someone remembering, it will fail when they're busy.

**8. Treating AI output as final.** Claude is a collaborator, not an oracle. Every output needs human judgment. /verify catches technical issues. /second-opinion catches strategic ones. Your brain catches everything else.

**9. Building for everyone.** Every /inquiry, /persona, and /scope protocol pushes for specificity because products built for "everyone" serve no one well.

**10. Ignoring what went wrong.** /incident and /retro exist because the most expensive mistake is the one you make twice. The compound loop turns failures into institutional knowledge.
